## Overview
### Description
Our app creates a platform to make it easier to to market and find Dine and Donate fundraisers (i.e. 10% of your bill at a restaurant will go towards a given charity/organization). Organizers of these events can post when and where they are having events. Users looking to find these events will be able to see when they are happening in their area.


### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Fundraising / Networking / Business
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as Facebook or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Make organizing dine & donate fundraisers between restaurants and charities easy, and allow these fundraisers to reach more diners.
- **Market:** 
    - User: 
        - Any individual who is eating at a restaurant and wants to donate to a charity. 
    - Restaurant owner:
        - Restaurants who would like to market through fundraising events.
    - Charity organizer:
        - Make donations to their charity more accessible to users
- **Habit:** 
    - Charities will remind users to download the app/use it. 
    - Upon ariving at events users will show their "voucher image" as apposed to the print-out flyers that these event organizers usually hand out. 
    - Push notifications will be sent to users to show upcoming nearby events to support.
- **Scope:** 
    - First we would make it so that users can see where/when dine & donates near them are happening. They would be able to save the events they are interested in and easily access the vouchers for these events. 
    - Eventually, we would make different profiles for charities and restaurants so users could follow them and get specific updates on their fundraisers. 
    - Another future goal could be to have verified restaurants, for which we keep data on past events to incentivize organizations to hold fundraisers with them.
    - Ultimately, we could automate the entire dine & donate process. We would be the third party between organizations and restaurants. We would set up these events for restaurants so that they would not have to worry about organizing the events, only accepting/denying the ones we have set up with local organizations.
